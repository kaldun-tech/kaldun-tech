## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Taras, an aspiring AWS Solutions Architect, Cloud Engineer, and software developer. I sometimes go by Ross in the US.

I'm passionate about all things math, especially encryption and blockchain. I previously worked in the energy industry at the intersection of development, DevOps, and QA automation leadership.
